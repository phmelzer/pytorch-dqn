    "Think about a video game where a player has a large environment to roam around in. Each state in the environment would be represented by a set of pixels, and the agent may be able to take serveral actions from each state. The iterative process of computing and updating Q-values for each state-action pair in a large state space becomes computationally inefficient and perhaps infeasible due to the computational resources and time this may take.\n",
